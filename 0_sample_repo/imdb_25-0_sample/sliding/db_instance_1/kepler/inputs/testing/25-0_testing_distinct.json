Grodnik told him, \"if you ever bring me a piece of material that I like, you can be a producer on it with me.\" 2 weeks later Matheson screened ''Zatoichi Challenged'' for Grodnik to develop as an American remake. It took 7 years, 3 studios, 2 directors, and 11 drafts of the script to finally get the film about a blind samurai in America made. Grodnik sold it to Jeff Sagansky, the president of Tri-Star Pictures, by pitching him two ad lines: ''Pray you see him before he hears you'' and ''He don''t need no dog.''",
