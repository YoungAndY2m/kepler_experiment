But when both Lionel and Big Al turn up dead, it becomes clear that Lionel wasn''t just any mark--as Jake soon learns, he was an accountant for eccentric crime boss Winston King. Never one to shy away from a challenge, Jake offers to repay The King by pulling off the biggest con of his career. The mark? Morgan Price, a banker with deep ties to organized crime. With so much riding on the outcome, Jake decides to bring in a brash, blonde pickpocket named Lily, who joins the crew in a complex scheme involving corporate loans, creative accounting, wire transfers and off-shore accounts.

He is wandering near the coast when he sees a young woman (Sandra Knight) and asks her for directions to Coldon, where he hopes to rejoin his regiment. But the woman doesn''t answer, doesn''t even greet him and walks away. Eventually she takes him towards the sea, where she disappears in rough water. Andre loses consciousness while trying to follow her, and is attacked by a bird and awakes in a house where an old woman (Dorothy Neumann) claims never to have seen the woman. After he leaves, he sees the woman again, and while trying to follow her, is saved by a man from certain death. Andre learns that in order to help the girl, he must go to castle of Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), and when he arrives, Andre sees the woman looking out of a window. However, Baron Von Leppe is old and seems reluctant to let Andre in. He claims there''s no woman in the castle, but shows Andre a painting which does indeed portray her. Andre learns that she is the Baroness, who died twenty years ago. What is the baron''s secret?', '1,839,900 (France)', 'UK:28 June 2003', 'USA:2 December 2008', 'Touggourt, Algeria",

They collect the valuable objects in the spot but they are attacked by a creature. Meanwhile, the discredited Professor Jack Randall, who wrote a book about Gargoyles rejected by the experts, is encouraged by his friend Carol Beckham to peek the place out. They sneak in the site during the night and while Carol is collecting some artifacts, Jack is recording with his camera. Out of the blue, Jack sees a winged monster coming towards him and he flees from the location with Carol, but breaks his camera. They go to a bar and a huge stone falls over his car. Jack takes a cab to his boarding house and Carol is attacked and beheaded by a Gargoyle at her apartment. On the next morning, Jack identifies Carol''s body and becomes the prime suspect of Inspector Gibert of several murders. Jack decides to seek out the reporter of a sensationalist newspaper, Nicole Ricard, and gives his tape to her cameraman Walsh. When Walsh recovers the badly shaped footage, he shows Nicole and they realize that Jack is not crazy and he had seen a Gargoyle indeed in the underground of the church. They decide to return to the church to investigate.', 'USA:18 March 1946', 'USA:20 March 1959', 'Brazil:4 July 1995', 'UK:7 November 1982",

Andrey felt in disgrace with the Communist Party thirty years ago for protecting the Jewish musicians and was no longer allowed to conduct an orchestra. One night, Andrey reads a just-received fax while cleaning the office of the Bolshoi''s director Leonid Vinichenko and he hides the document. He learns that the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet Theater in Paris has just invited the Bolshoi Orchestra to perform a concert in Paris within two weeks. Andrey shows the fax to his friend and musician Aleksandr ''Sasha'' Abramovich Grosman that drives an ambulance and he decides to reunite fifty-five former musicians of Bolshoi to travel to Paris and perform The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35, by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He invites the Communist leader and former KGB Ivan Gavrilov to manage the orchestra and he requests the solo of the prominent musician Anne-Marie Jacquet and to stay in Paris for three days. When they arrive in Paris, Andrey meets Anne-Marie while the musicians wander in the city, partying and raising money. The unprofessionalism of the Russian musicians forces Anne-Marie to call off the concert; but Sasha convinces her to come to the theater. Meanwhile Andrey grieves the incident with the violinist Lea thirty years ago and hides a secret from Anne-Marie.

Furthermore, this would have instantly dated a film that was due to open in November, so in January 1997 when production was kicking off, a frantic rewrite of the script was taking place. With all the actors on board and ready to film, the new script also had to tally with their visions of their characters.

                "In ''Sam Hamm'' (qv)''s original script, the first time we see Smylex''s effect (called Smylenol in the script) is on the two female models, who are only represented as cardboard cut-outs in Joker''s commercial. The original scene has them in a bikini photo session with a photographer who is urging them to smile more as he snaps away. The girls begin to giggle, which at first pleases the photographer, then their giggles become laughter, then uncontrollable helpless hysterics, which has the photographer going from mild annoyance to complete horror as the exhausted girls expire from forced hilarity, with the ghastly Joker-like grins frozen on their faces. As it was originally intended, the death scene is much more protracted than the one with the female newscaster, depicting death by Smylex as a particularly agonizing, if mirthful, way to go.', '5605', 'MET:2468.58 m', 'May 2009 -', 'USA:30 May 1950",

For my part, I''ve done as much as I can to bring the truth to light. And the truth is this: Your son is dead for only one reason. I wasn''t strong enough to stop it. Always, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Andrew Markinson, United States Marine Corps.::[puts pistol in his mouth, we hear a gunshot as the scene changes back to the courtroom]', 'USA:4 December 2006', 'USA:4 April 1999', 'Italy:13 April 1976', 'Russia:20 May 2004",

Burton is a major fan of ''Mario Bava'' (qv)''s Gothic horror films, and, as an homage to Bava''s _Operazione paura (1966)_ (qv), Burton adopted the basic plot of Bava picture: a skeptical investigator who places his faith in science and reason treks to an out-of-the-way hamlet plagued by a murderous ghost, only to have his skepticism of the supernatural forcibly broken down by the experience. The film includes numerous visual references to Bava''s films, including a scene in which Ichabod dreams of seeing his mother''s spike-pierced face after his father killed her - an image drawn from Bava''s _La maschera del demonio (1960)_ (qv), a film Burton was once slated to remake.', 'Chile:5 March 2004', '997,155 (Spain)', 'Croatia:24 May 2009', 'MET:1383.79 m",

Father Pino Amitrano is a truck driver, and is often away. Even when he''s at home he deals with dodgy villagers and other friends, while mother Anna spoils his useless kid sister Maria rotten. Michele is mostly left doing his sisters chores, getting either of them out of trouble, roaming the sparsely populated grain lands on his bicycle and playing with local kids, which often means minor trouble. One day after a dare leads the mildly mischievous gang to a ruined house, he returns alone to retrieve the glasses that his sister had left behind. Michele accidentally finds a deep hole outside, beneath a metal cover, and sees a boy''s bare foot under a blanket inside. At first Michele rides off for his life, but soon he returns, and after some more scary and disappointing tries finds out it''s a boy his age, blinded by a living his life in the dark, deep hole. Michele conquers his fear and the boy, Filippo''s, confidence, and generously feeds and entertains him.

                "The sudden decapitation of Lord Harkin has the Kingdom, as well it should, in a state of fear. For it is well known to one and all of the citizens around and about that Norman, the evil Duke of Norwich (played by who cares) and his buddies, bimbos and cohorts over at---Drum Roll---The Torture Dungeon are responsible. Norman has plans to marry off his dimwit half-brother Albert of Aberthy to Heather McGregor of No Title, the most beautiful and sensual girl in the Kingdom. But first he has to arrange for the pitchforking of her current squeeze, William the Nobody. Heather has no idea of what she is getting into but, following the spectacular Royal Wedding followed by the erotic ceremony of the spectacular consumation of the Royal Marriage, she begins to suspect that all that is rotten does not lie entirely in Denmark, especially if Andy Milligan is around. Norman''S half sisters---this guy has no full siblings---Lady Agatha and Lady Jane, in a very good effort to warn Heather of Norman''s methods, take her down to roll--The Torture Dungeon. She is terrified at what she sees, which is somewhat surprising for one who has just been exposed to Albert, as it is basically gory sights of mutilated victims. Norman, a man with a plan, has his henchmen, Ivan the Terrible Dwarf and Maudlin the Execeutioner, do away with Albert, Lady Jane and Lady Agatha and is attempting to kill Heather, who is but doesn''t know it, the true heir to the throne recently vacated by the late, decapitated Lord Harkin. But, Norman is foiled by Margaret the Hag, a disfigured member of the Court, who spears him to death just before she is trampled to death by a horse, or audience members stampeding for the exits.', 'UK:September 1906', 'USA:6 August 1931', 'UK:17 July 1974', 'Denmark:1975",
