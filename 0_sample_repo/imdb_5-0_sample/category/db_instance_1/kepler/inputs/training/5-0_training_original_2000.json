                "In the early twentieth century, happy-go-lucky ''Pearl White'' (qv), working as a seamstress in a costume shop, is always distracted and more interested in becoming an entertainer, most specifically an actress. She gets her wish when she gets an impromptu introduction to a second rate traveling theater troupe called the Farrington Players, headed by its lead actor Mike Farrington who reluctantly offers her a job. She quickly befriends other troupe members, such as Timmy Timmons and Julia Gibbs, but Pearl''s less than subtle nature continually irks Mike, as it does not mesh with the serious nature of their productions. But that does not stop Pearl from falling in love with Mike, and in time Mike falling in love with Pearl. Despite her fellow thespians not considering it acting, Pearl, with Julia at her side, gets a lucrative job acting in movies, where her broad style is more well suited. Pearl becomes one of the most famous movie actresses of her time, specifically in the serial _The Perils of Pauline (1914)_ (qv), where the lead character, played by Pearl, is always in physical danger, much like Pearl always is in doing many of her own stunts. As the professional fortunes of Pearl and Mike rise and fall, generally in opposite directions at any given point in time, they have to decide if their love for each other can overcome being in the other''s shadow.', '6520', 'USA:7 July 1989', 'MET:4616.25 m', 'UK:29 October 1945",

Do you imagine your daddy being shamed by your disgrace? Do you see him in his plain pine box crushed by your failure; a sorry, petty end of a promising career? What is worst about this humiliation Clarice? Is it how your failure will reflect on your mommy and daddy? Is your worst fear that people will now and forever believe they were indeed just good old trailer camp tornado bait white trash and that perhaps you are too? By the way I couldn''t help noticing on the FBI''s rather dull public website that I have been hoisted from the Bureau''s archives of the common criminal and elevated to the more prestigious 10 Most Wanted list.

But Gilliam is a dreamer, much like his title character, and his vision for the movie is uncompromising, meaning with the reduced budget that there is no margin for error and that some of his department heads may have to achieve miracles with their allotted moneys.

Most are inconsequential (in the VHS version, Kris''s father compares him to \"an accountant\" while in the DVD he refers to \"a bookeeper\") but the VHS version''s subtitles are incomplete, simplifying some passages and eliminating simple phrases. Early on, Kris''s father refers to \"that damned Solaristics\" (sic) in the VHS version; the subtitles in the DVD say \"These Solarists.\" (In this scene, the VHS version may be more accurate: the DVD commentary by the film historians refers to the line as \"damned Solaristics.\") Also, the VHS verson has Sartorius saying \"All the rest is bullshit,\" while the DVD has him saying, \"Everything else is whim.\" Also, in the in the VHS version, several of the black-and-white segments (including the film of Burton''s debriefing) are sepia-toned, and one color shot goes to black-and-white after Kris passes in front of the camera (the scene is completely black-and-white in the DVD). The scene where Kris sees Hari for the second time is in black-and-white on VHS, but it has an orange, sunset-like tone in the DVD (possibly tinted black-and-white). These differences are clearly not a result of remastering or color-correction.
