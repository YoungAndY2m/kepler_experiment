She quickly befriends other troupe members, such as Timmy Timmons and Julia Gibbs, but Pearl''s less than subtle nature continually irks Mike, as it does not mesh with the serious nature of their productions. But that does not stop Pearl from falling in love with Mike, and in time Mike falling in love with Pearl. Despite her fellow thespians not considering it acting, Pearl, with Julia at her side, gets a lucrative job acting in movies, where her broad style is more well suited. Pearl becomes one of the most famous movie actresses of her time, specifically in the serial _The Perils of Pauline (1914)_ (qv), where the lead character, played by Pearl, is always in physical danger, much like Pearl always is in doing many of her own stunts.

Do you imagine your daddy being shamed by your disgrace? Do you see him in his plain pine box crushed by your failure; a sorry, petty end of a promising career? What is worst about this humiliation Clarice? Is it how your failure will reflect on your mommy and daddy? Is your worst fear that people will now and forever believe they were indeed just good old trailer camp tornado bait white trash and that perhaps you are too? By the way I couldn''t help noticing on the FBI''s rather dull public website that I have been hoisted from the Bureau''s archives of the common criminal and elevated to the more prestigious 10 Most Wanted list. Is this coincidence, or are you back on the case? If so, goody goody, cause I need to come out of retirement and return to public life.
