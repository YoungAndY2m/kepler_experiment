The novel''s basic premise is that a plane crashes on a remote island and the only survivors is a group of schoolboys. The group eventually splits into two factions, one staying on the beach waiting for rescue, the other moving to a rocky area with designs on being on the island long-term. Just like the survivors in the early season, the boys in the novel try to maintain a signal fire in hopes of being rescued. One of the characters in the novel is named Jack, who is a leader of sorts but a much less sympathetic one (the character Jack in the TV series is more like the novel''s Ralph). Also, there is a character similar to Hurley called Piggy, who is overweight and whose real name is never revealed (Hurley''s real name Hugo is mentioned for the first time later on). The TV character John Locke resembles the novel''s Simon. Also, in both stories there are rumors about a monster on the island.', 'Norway:16 July 2004', 'Norway:20 June 2005', 'Slovenia:36', 'Kimberly Miner",
