Just like the survivors in the early season, the boys in the novel try to maintain a signal fire in hopes of being rescued. One of the characters in the novel is named Jack, who is a leader of sorts but a much less sympathetic one (the character Jack in the TV series is more like the novel''s Ralph). Also, there is a character similar to Hurley called Piggy, who is overweight and whose real name is never revealed (Hurley''s real name Hugo is mentioned for the first time later on).
