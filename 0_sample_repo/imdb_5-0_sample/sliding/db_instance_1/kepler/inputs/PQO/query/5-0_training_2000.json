When the show moved to the big screen, he was finally able to make Klingons look more alien. The resulting continuity break between TOS and the movies and later series was addressed in _\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" (1993) {Trials and Tribble-ations (#5.6)}_ (qv) in which the character of Worf confirms that something did happen to make the Klingons appear human, but he says that they \"do not discuss it with outsiders.\" Miles O''Brien asks if it was some kind of genetic engineering while Julian Bashir suggests a viral mutation. In the fourth and final season of the fifth \"Star Trek\" series _\"Enterprise\" (2001)_ (qv) a two-parter dealt with the exact nature of why some Klingons (that would be the Klingons from the original series) did not have the \"knotted\" forehead that visually characterized all Klingons portrayed starting with _Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)_ (qv). The premise was that a group of Klingons on a Klingon-populated world separate from their home world are exposed to a virus that modifies their appearance to that of the way they looked in TOS (and the crew, especially the ship''s doctor in _\"Enterprise\" (2001)_ (qv) manage to discover and generate a medical fix for the malady, of course).

Bennett''s death was also trimmed to remove focus on his suffering. The 2001 UK DVD release retained these cuts and also added a further 44 seconds of distributor cuts. This was because the DVD master used for the UK release was a censored German cut. All cuts were fully waived in 2007 by the BBFC. The heavily edited 2001 UK version, with a total of 56 seconds removed, was also used as the master for the initial Australian DVD release. In this version additional edits include: - In the opening scene, after Cooke (''Bill Duke (I)'' (qv)) has initially shot the man in the robe, he walks over to the body and shoots him again. This second hit has been removed. - When Matrix breaks Henriques'' (''Charles Meshack'' (qv)) neck on the plane, he simply elbows him, and in the next shot, Henrqiues is already dead. The shot of Matrix snapping Henriques neck is gone. - The shot of the piece of wood sticking through Cooke''s stomach is absent. - All close ups of the pole in Bennett''s (''Vernon Wells (I)'' (qv)) stomach are gone.', 'Japan:23 July 1980', '764,000 (Sweden)', 'Data: Holy S-H-I-T!', 'UK:6 October 1973')\n AND t.production_year > 1984;",

The MGM USA DVD is also the most complete version. They include the following changes from and additions to the \"uncut\" Vestron version: This version has no end credits. The movie ends with the same montage of each character, but no actors'' names are printed over the scenes. After the montage, the movie''s end theme song continues to play over a blank screen where the final production credits normally appears. Also, the scene showing the killers as they carry the women down the stairs normally has the \"Early next morning\" credit at the bottom of the screen. In this version, this credit is missing. Since it is impossible to undo such a thing, this print must be from a time before the movie was completed. These scenes are added in addition: - In the scene where Krug tells Weasel to cut Mari with his switchblade, this version goes on to show a close-up of Mari''s bloody fingers with the voice-over, \"Phyllis, he cut me!\" This version goes on to show a wet patch on Phyllis'' pants and a shot of the two semi-nude women holding each other. - In the scene where Junior pleads, \"You''re gonna kill someone if you''re not careful,\" this versions'' scene has Junior continue, \"...make ''em make it with each other.\" Sadie agrees, \"That''s a good idea!\" Krug replies, \"Make it with each other.\" - The chase through the woods is longer. The added scene shows Weasel and Phyllis facing each other on opposite sides of the river. Phyllis gives him the bird and screams, \"Screw, Creep!\" Weasel''s angry reaction ends the scene. - During the carving scene, this version contains additional shots of the sheriff getting out of his police car and walking. - The dialog between Weasel and Mrs. Collingwood during the fellatio scene is lengthier in this version.', 'Germany:6 June 2000', 'USA:7 November 1992', 'USA:20 June 1981', 'UK:4 March 1979')\n AND t.production_year > 1971;",

Initially, director ''Spike Lee'' (qv) had requested $33 million for the film, a reasonable sum considering the size and scope of the project but far greater than his previous budgets. Additionally, his five previous films combined grossed less than $100 million domestically. As a result of this (and the studio''s reluctance to fund black-themed material), Warner Bros. only offered $20 million for a two-hour and 15-minute film, plus an additional $8 million from Largo Entertainment for the foreign rights. When the film went $5 million over budget, Lee kicked in most of his salary, but failed to keep the financiers from shutting down post-production. Lee went public with his battles and raised funds from celebrity friends, such as ''Oprah Winfrey'' (qv), ''Michael Jordan (I)'' (qv), and ''Bill Cosby'' (qv) to regain control of his embattled project. Warner eventually kicked in more funds after a positive screening of a rough cut.', 'UK:3 September 1999', 'Austria:183', 'Brazil:7 July 1975', 'Ireland:July 1992')\n AND t.production_year > 1991;",

It shows the British Army in perfect formation shooting French soldiers and Huron Indians. - A longer version of the Britsh surrender is shown.
