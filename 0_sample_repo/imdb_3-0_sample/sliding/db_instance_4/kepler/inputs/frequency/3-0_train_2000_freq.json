    "[\"%o%\", \"The Japanese cut, while only a little over a minute longer than the US cut, features not only a full color version of the \\\"House of Blue Leaves\\\" fight, but some quick new shots in the anime scenes as well as some alternate footage, most cut/altered to avoid an NC-17 rating: - The opening scene between The Bride and Vernita Green has two alternate angles shown when The Bride asks for a towel instead of keeping the overhead shot. - In the anime sequence, one of Boss Matsumoto''s men has his face smashed into a wall twice, rather then just once. - In the anime sequence, when O-Ren Ishii kills Matsumoto and tells him to look at her face, she asks him to look at more facial features (nose, chin. etc.) to be recognized, and then before pulling the knife out, there is a close up shot of her moving the knife up his stomach and then finally pulling it out. There are a couple of close up shots of Matsumoto''s face as he''s dying as well that were eliminated from the US print and then a pan up shot of Matsumoto''s blood covered and disemboweled body. - The \\\"House of Blue Leaves\\\" fight is not only in full color, but features about 9 new shots missing from the US print which include: - A close up of the first female Crazy 88 (Julie Manase) gargling blood after being pinned to a wooden pillar by a sword. This shot, while cut from the US version of Vol 1, showed up in the end credits of the US cut of Vol 2. - A shot of The Bride stabbing two Crazy 88s at once using her own sword as well as another Crazy 88''s sword. - A ten foot high super backflip that The Bride executes before landing back down to pop out one of the Crazy 88''s eyes. This shot appeared in the TV spot teaser, but disappeared soon after. - After The Bride pops out the one Crazy 88''s eye, as another one charges at her screaming, she simply throws the eye into the attackers mouth, causing him to start to choke. The partially armless Sofie Fatale gives a follow up disgusted reaction. - A shot of another female Crazy 88 attacking only to get slashed in the throat and spraying blood everywhere. - The first appearance of the \\\"Kid Crazy 88\\\" (the one who gets spanked with the sword). In this shot, we now find out why he''s missing a mask later on. As he''s about to attack The Bride, she swipes his mask off. We see he''s just a kid, and he gives the universal \\\"don''t hurt me\\\" sign. The Bride has a look of shock on her face in realizing he''s just a kid, so she grabs him, throws him across, knocking 3-4 Crazy 88 into a blood filled mini pool. This shot of the 3-4 falling, while cut from the US version of Vol 1, also showed up in the end credits of the US cut of Vol 2. Overall, this \\\"mini scene\\\" helps establish The Bride''s look of surprise even more when she sees the young Crazy 88 the last time... and his follow up \\\"don''t hurt me\\\" look even funnier. - A shot of a Crazy 88 getting slashed across the chest and spraying blood all over a wall. - When The Bride jumps onto the shoulders of one of the Crazy 88, after she slashes another one across the face, the Crazy 88 she''s standing on tries to attack her from below. She parries the attack and cuts his hands off. The shot then cuts to the forward sommersault. - Since the fight is already in color, the close up \\\"eye shot\\\" of The Bride blinking is cut. Instead, the first part of the close up before she blinks is shown, however, at the point when she normally blinks, there is a replacement medium shot of her standing slightly fatigued and holding her sword out. - Finally, after the \\\"House of Blue Leaves\\\" fight, is the most infamous of the missing scenes and that is Sofie Fatale''s extended \\\"trunk interrogation\\\" scene. After The Bride warns Sofie about cutting off something, instead of cutting back to Sofie in the hospital, The Bride is shown grabbing Sofie''s arm and screams \\\"GIVE ME YOUR OTHER ARM!\\\". Sofie starts to panic, but then The Bride chops off her other arm, causing blood to splash onto the screen and Sofie begins screaming again.', 'CAD 22,000', 'Evil is in the air.', 'Italy:2 May 2006', 'January 2001 - ?\", 2002]": 1,

Created in Metro City, he lives among a ''retro-futuristic'' society populated by humans and robots. His creator Dr. Tenma, head of the Ministry of Science, builds Astro in his son''s image. Astro never can fill the void that Dr. Tenma feels over the loss of his son. Tenma shuts down Astro, burns down the Ministry of Science and flees. Some time later, Astro is discovered by Dr. O''Shay, the new head of the Ministry. Dr. O''Shay takes in Astro and serves as his mentor. Driven by the belief that robots and humans should be friends, Dr. O''Shay is Astro''s greatest ally. He provides Astro with a home, enrolls him in school and creates a robot family for him. Astro possesses superb strength, including jet-rocket feet and arms that allow him to fly at extreme speeds. However, the secret to his victories is not his super-powers; the quality that makes him superior to other robots is his artificial brain, the most advanced in the world. This unique quality, termed kokoro in Japanese, allows Astro to experience all of the same emotions as humans. He''s clever, resourceful and has a strong sense of justice, always attempting to reason with his adversaries. Mankind''s only hope of surviving the onslaught of rebellious robots is a robot himself...the fearless, selfless, incorruptible champion known as Astro. In his quest for peace and justice, Astro often goes it alone, but he is occasionally aided by his robot sister or even rebel robots that he is able to enlist.
