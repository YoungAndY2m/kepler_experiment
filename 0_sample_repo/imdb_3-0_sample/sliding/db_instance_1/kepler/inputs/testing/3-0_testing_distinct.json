It was the first Bond film not to feature ''Bernard Lee (I)'' (qv) as M, who had played the role in the previous eleven films in the series. Lee died of stomach cancer on January 16, 1981, after the filming of \"For Your Eyes Only\" had started but before his scenes were shot. Although ''Bernard Lee (I)'' (qv) was dying of stomach cancer, he did try to film at least one scene in the movie, but in the end it was too much for him and he had to bow out. He died not long after. As a result, Q''s role in the film was slightly expanded to fill the gap. As such, a number of scenes originally intended to include M were re-written with Q, e.g. the confessional scene. As a mark of respect, producer ''Albert R. Broccoli'' (qv) refused to recast the role, changing the script to say that M was on leave.
