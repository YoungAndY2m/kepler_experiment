Lester decided to scrap most of Oscar-winning cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth''''s footage, and hired director ''Michael Winner'' (qv)''s cinematographer, ''Robert Paynter'' (qv), to create a style that would evoke Superman''s roots in comic books. Lester, Paynter and camera operator ''Freddie Cooper'' (qv) replaced Unsworth''s gliding camera with horizontal panning and static framing to evoke comic books and comic strips, with static frames crammed with people and objects. Similarly, the composition of shots the trio developed for _Superman II (1980)_ (qv) had objects and people crammed into the frame. To further emphasize comic book composition, the action was photographed from one angle, to give the film a desired flatness. Harkening back to the techniques of the early sound era, Lester''s films had always been shot with three cameras filming the action simultaneously; two cameras for close-ups, one for the long shot.
