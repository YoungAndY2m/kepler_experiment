Lester decided to scrap most of Oscar-winning cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth''''s footage, and hired director ''Michael Winner'' (qv)''s cinematographer, ''Robert Paynter'' (qv), to create a style that would evoke Superman''s roots in comic books. Lester, Paynter and camera operator ''Freddie Cooper'' (qv) replaced Unsworth''s gliding camera with horizontal panning and static framing to evoke comic books and comic strips, with static frames crammed with people and objects. Similarly, the composition of shots the trio developed for _Superman II (1980)_ (qv) had objects and people crammed into the frame. To further emphasize comic book composition, the action was photographed from one angle, to give the film a desired flatness. Harkening back to the techniques of the early sound era, Lester''s films had always been shot with three cameras filming the action simultaneously; two cameras for close-ups, one for the long shot. Lester''s technique added to the friction on the set caused by Donner''s firing.

The United States, the United Kingdom, and other members of NATO angrily condemn the Soviet aggression and military activity in the United Kingdom starts to mount, especially at the nearby R.A.F. base. The families of Ruth & Jimmy go about their daily business, paying little attention to what is going on in Iran. One spring day, without warning, the Soviet Union attacks the United Kingdom with ICBMs - two of which hit Sheffield, annihilating most of the city and its inhabitants.

                "The Australian version titled ''Wrong Bet'' is edited for violence, but contains other scenes not shown in the version titled ''Lionheart''. Some edited scenes in ''Wrong Bet'' are: When Lyon''s brother gets set on fire (whole scene edited), the scene where Lyon escapes from the Legion, the bit where Lyon stabs the guy in the hand is edited, exchanged looks with Lyon and Atila with bloody faces at the end of the match when Lyon is about to punch him is edited on ''Wrong Bet'' also. There are more scenes edited as well. Some extra scenes in ''Wrong Bet'' include a scene where Lyon comes out of the water after jumping out of the boat, a scene where Cynthia swears at Lyon and demands him to get out of her room when Lyon wants to setup an account. The most interesting scene shown in ''Wrong Bet'' is an alternate take in the hospital when Lyon finds out his brother dies. In ''Lionheart'', when Lyon asks the doctor if they have found the killers, the doctor says yes. In ''Wrong Bet'', the doctor says no, and they may never find out who the killers were. It''s possible that ''A.W.O.L'', released in UK, is the same as ''Wrong Bet''.', 'UK:12 December 1963', 'USA:20 August 1966', 'MET:2888 m', 'Japan:22 May 1982",

Berry-Berry has always taken the easy way out, and will often use his good looks to take advantage of women, who are initially more than willing to help out this good looking young man until they really get to know him. But his parents, especially Annabell, believe he can do no wrong. And his bright sixteen year old brother, Clinton Willart, idolizes him. Although Berry-Berry originally had no intention of ever returning to Cleveland which Ralph realizes but Annabell refuses to acknowledge in her heart, he decides to head back to Cleveland but initially not tell his family. Berry-Berry''s trip home coincides with a visit the Willarts receive from a family friend, thirty-one year old Echo O''Brien. It''s love at first sight between Berry-Berry and Echo. Although Clinton, who loves Echo himself with Echo in turn loving him like her best kid brother, gives Berry-Berry his blessing with Echo, Clinton, deep in his heart, is afraid that Echo will end up just another one of the long string of women that Berry-Berry has abused.', 'Norway:80', 'France:1 July 1974', 'ML 102356', 'Iran:1964",

Before WWII he develops the first rocket launch center in Central Russia and makes the \"Katyusha\" weapon. In spite of his arrest and imprisonment, he continues working on rocket design. He is released from prison upon his request to fight in the front-line against the Nazis. After WWII he makes a new rocket system for the nuclear missiles program, and another new rocket that launched \"Sputnik\" in 1957. Next achievement is the first man in space and several other human space missions. Korolev''s uncompromising character causes him many problems with Soviet politicians, and he dies from a heart attack. His mission is carried on by his colleagues. Note: Footages of Baykonur Kosmodrome in Kazakhstan and of the Soviet Space Center in Moscow are adding authenticity to the film, but most of the footage had not been released to the public. The original director''s cut had 5500 meters of film length, but then it was shown to Brezhnev and Politbureau and was censored before the public release in 1972; the film was reduced to 4553m and ran 166 minutes.
