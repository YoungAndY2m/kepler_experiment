We had to do something, but what I had no idea. And nobody else seemed to know either, so we tried to put it out of mind. The S-Mart''s construction still wasn''t completely certain, and either way it was still relatively far off, so we were able to carry on as though nothing had ever happened. Working at the Supermarket was a lot easier if you were able to keep yourself from thinking it may not be there much longer. You could tell the stress was taking its toll on the managers and on all the older employees who''d been there for a long time. A lot of them were too set in their ways to have much luck getting different jobs, but to them the only thing worse than the Supermarket closing would be having to go to the S-Mart hat in hand to ask for a job as a greeter. To tell the truth, a lotta the time I had things on my mind that kept the S-Mart issue on the back burner. But I knew were running out of time, that every day from this point on was another day closer to the S-Mart. And that every day was vital.

Korea.\" - Jake and Elwood discuss getting the money for the mission honestly outside of the Triple Rock Baptist Church. - The \"The Old Landmark\" number is considerably longer, incorporating more dance sequences and extra verses. - After the demolition derby in the shopping mall Elwood parks the Bluesmobile in a hiding place beside an electrical power box. (John Landis explains that Aykroyd thought this would show how the car gets its incredible endurance, but also goes on to explain that it never did make any sense, so the scene was cut.) - A few extra lines of dialog when Elwood and Jake rest in his apartment. - When the cops come to arrest Jake and Elwood in the motel, they first stop at the registration desk and intimidate the manager. They also greet Sam, who seems to be known by everyone. - An entire sequence with Elwood boosting chemicals from his day job, then quitting the job to become a priest, is restored. - After the above sequence, Jake and Elwood study a cigarette box with \"the last known address of Bones Malone and Blue Lou Marini\". - After getting the new address of Bones Malone, Elwoods thanks Ms Tarantino before leaving. - Jake has an extra line of dialog while pep-talking Murph and the Magictones at the Holiday Inn (\"Now, who here at this table can honestly say that they played any finer or felt any better than they did when they played with the Blues Brothers?\") - One line of dialog for Henry Gibson is restored for the Illinois Nazis scene at the bridge, with regards to the swastika (\"The sacred and ancient symbol of your race since the beginning of time!\") - The \"Boom Boom\" number is much longer, with extra shots of John Lee Hooker laughing and arguing with his band. Jake and Elwood watch for a moment then enter the Soul Food Cafe. - \"Think\" has extra verses and shots of dancing. - When the band arrives at Bob''s Country Bunker, Bob hands the request list to Bones Malone, who looks at it blankly. - The \"Theme from Rawhide\" and \"Stand By Your Man\" numbers are slightly longer. - The original Picwood preview included another musical number, \"Sink the Bismark\", but that footage has been lost. - More lines of dialog for Maury Sline in the steam room scene, mostly regarding to the old gigs having been turned into (gay) discos. - When Jake fills up the tank for the Bluesmobile, he overfills it and gas spills over. When they peel out from the station, Elwood flicks a cigarette out of the window and causes the station to explode. (Landis now says he doesn''t remember why this particular scene was cut.) - Before the sound-check Curtis (Cab Calloway) explains to the band that they need to do it for the kids, since the Blues Brothers will use the money raised from that concert to pay the taxes for a church. The look on the faces of the band after they hear it is priceless! - The \"Minnie the Moocher\" number is considerably extended. - As Jake and Elwood sneak into the show, Elwood takes the chemicals that he stole from the show and sneaks them into the tires of the cop cars. - Both the \"Everybody Needs Someone to Love\" and \"Sweet Home Chicago\" numbers are extended. - When Jake and Elwood sneak out, the gas in the cop cars tires reacts and causes the tires to explode on some to delay the police. - An alternate line of dialog for Carrie Fisher in the sewer when she confronts Jake, about how her father \"used up her last favors\" with the Mafia for her wedding. In the original release it was changed due to complaints of the Italian-American community. - The lengthy climactic chase to (and through) Chicago features many extra lines and shots of racing autos. - The \"assault on Daley plaza\" and the Assessor''s Office scenes also feature extra lines and shots. - The \"Jailhouse Rock\" number is slightly longer. - As the prisoners riot at the end of the film, there is a brief shot of riot-geared police guards racing into the mess hall that has been added. It changes the end of the film subtly. - The \"cast of characters\" and end credits are extended to accommodate the new footage.', '$11,250', 'Canada:5 March 1986', 'USA:24 June 1965', 'Spain:10 April 1989",

She now also turns down Silverbridge''s proposal, telling him that she considers him immature but agrees to hear an additional renewed proposal in the future.

Silver tells his disappointed father that he will stand for Parliament as a Tory, breaking the family''s Liberal tradition and later meets Isabel Boncassen, a strikingly attractive American girl traveling with her parents.

He and his accomplice, Cojo (a little person), are hiding from the police, and Alonzo views his disguise as perfect, especially since it keeps from view an unusual deformity of his left hand that would immediately give him away as the burglar. Nanon, the daughter of the circus owner, is the target in his act. Although Alonzo is in love with her, Nanon''s father despises him. Nanon is attracted to Malabar, the circus strong man, but she is also repulsed by his uninhibited sexual advances and desire to touch and hold her. Apparently her phobia extends to the touch of any man. Alonzo feeds her fears in the hopes that Nanon will fall in love with him since he is \"armless.\" Because Zanzi discovers Alonzo really has arms, Alonzo kills him, but Nanon witnesses the killing without seeing Alonzo''s face; however, she does see the telltale deformity of his left hand. As Alonzo continues to plot to steal Nanon away from Mirabar, Cojo makes him realize that she will hate him once she discovers he has arms---and the deformity showing that he is her father''s murderer. Alonzo decides to have his left arm amputated, which he succeeds in doing through blackmailing a surgeon. He thinks Nanon will forgive him for hiding the fact that he has ONE arm. While Alonzo is recuperating from the surgery, Nanon gets over her fear of being touched and falls completely in love with Mirabar. Discovering this upon his return, Alonzo hatches a scheme to kill Mirabar as he attempts his latest, most daring stunt. Although the stunt goes horribly awry, it is Alonzo who gets killed.', 'UK:3 February 1940', 'USA:20 October 1949', 'Brazil:10 July 1992', 'MET:2758 m",
