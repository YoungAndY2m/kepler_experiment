The first depicts a battle between Batman and Artemis, which occurs in the park when the Amazons attempt to kidnap Kara from Superman. In the battle Artemis is close to winning a hand-to-hand fight with Batman. Before being defeated Batman resorts to using a dart gun on Artemis in order to gain the upper hand. The second scene that is skipped is the fight between SPOILER: Superman and Supergirl. In this fight instead of using a ''clap'' sound wave attack Superman takes a Kryptonite ring out of his belt buckle and puts it on to harm Kara, although harming himself in the process. The third omitted scene depicts Wonder Woman as being involved in defending Kara from Darkseid on the Kent farm near the end of the film. Instead of Darksied being sent into space, in the original comic he is duped into believing his Omega Beams had destroyed Kara and Superman fights with him while dragging Darkseid through space in anger before trapping Darkseid in the source wall which is located at the end of the universe.', 'UK:26 March 2007', 'USA:19 July 2002', 'August 2008 - ?', 'Japan:17 May 1991",

I mean, the storyline in Adventure Duo is quite impenetrable, so we didn''t feel that teenagers would particularly go for this material. It''s one of the reasons that we insisted that the name be changed from Adventure Kids to Adventure Duo.\" - The second episode was cut by 7 minutes and 35 seconds with the following justification by the BBFC: - \"Let me show you a scene we cut from Adventure Duo which features teenage heroes who get into all sorts of adventures, yet the film also contains very realistic portrayals of sex including autoeroticism and sexual assault. This is from Adventure Duo 2 which is set in Japan during the Second World War. We are introduced to an impotent scientist whose wife is sexually frustrated and the episode starts with her masturbating in a highly realistic and sexually arousing fashion. Her husband interrupts her and she asks him to make love to her but he refuses and goes back to his laboratory. A few minutes later a group of soldiers arrive and decide to humiliate the scientist by raping his wife in front of him. It''s one of the longest, strongest and highly realistic rape scenes I have ever seen in Japanese animation. And what the Board found particularly worrying is that this woman is forced to admit to the rapist that she is enjoying the experience. And when the woman finally orgasms there''s no doubt that the underlying message is that women can enjoy rape as long as it''s done well. - And in cutting this scene, we''re making a decision about the presentation of sexual violence across the board, whether the audience is 18 or 80. It was our view that even if this material isn''t corrupting underage viewers, current social attitudes dictate that this kind of sexual violence is unacceptable. Not only does the law compel us to censor material, public opinion does as well, and public opinion is something we monitor very closely.\" - The third episode was cut by 9 minutes and 28 seconds by the BBFC, all cuts were to graphic sex scenes.', '$10,000,000 (USA)', 'Austria:5 May 2003', 'USA:28 May 2001', 'Portugal:5 May 2003",

But there is a stalker who wants Dooley dead. The stalker, disgruntled crime novelist Devon Lane, became obsessed with Dooley''s wife after she rejected his book, and he blames Dooley for her death. When Jerry Lee can''t keep up with chasing Devon during a shootout, Captain Byers teams Dooley and Jerry Lee with a younger K9 team -- aggressive female detective Welles and her dog Zeus, a young, strong Doberman Pincher. After Dooley futilely investigates a convict he once busted, the dogs get him back on track by sniffing out Devon''s storage locker. The room reveals Devon''s identity to Dooley, and one of Devon''s manuscripts reveals that he intends to make Dooley suffer for his words. When Devon makes a bold move by invading the precinct and taking Welles hostage, it''s Dooley and Jerry Lee to the rescue. But can Jerry Lee pull off this rescue?', 'Monumental Pictures', 'Germany:46', '\u00e2\u0082\u00ac 1,500,000', 'Italy:1994",
