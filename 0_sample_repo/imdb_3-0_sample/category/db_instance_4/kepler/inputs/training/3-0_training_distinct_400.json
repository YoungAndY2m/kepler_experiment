(9:35-35:53) 2. 9/11: An overview of the numerous questionable aspects of this immensely important event. (35:54-1:09:16) 3. The Federal Reserve Bank: A history of its formation and ability to control the economy. (1:09:17-1:56:23) With many news clips from tragic events in history, audio excerpts from those who believe people are being misled about the level of freedom they have, this riveting documentary will anger those who agree with it as well as those who do not.

Over the course of the following year, the four teens find their friendships all horribly strained and all but terminated completely from the trauma. Come the next Fourth of July, just before the town''s annual carnival, the four teens all find themselves being victimized by a mysterious menace when they begin to receive intimidating calling cards indicating someone is aware of what happened before. The group suspect the cousin of the dead friend, only to discover they are very much on the wrong track. Can the friends survive and figure out the identity of their tormentor before they end up dead themselves?', 'MET:3511 m', 'Netherlands:74', 'Hungary:9 July 2009', 'USA:13 October 1998",
