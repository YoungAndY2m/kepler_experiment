                "This animated short movie outlines the history of traditional jazz music in a virtual walk-through of a shadow art museum. Shadow art is a unique form of sculptural art that exploits the fact that we can recognize objects from their shadows or silhouettes. Improvisation, a key ingredient of jazz music, is mirrored in the ambiguity of a shadow sculpture: many different 3D shapes can cast the same 2D shadow. The movie highlights five different milestones in the evolution of jazz: the early songs of field workers, ragtime, New Orleans jazz, swing, and bebop. Each era is represented with a room containing 3D sculptures which cast multiple shadow images at the same time. This unique property is achieved using a novel computational method for the interactive creation and manipulation of shadow art. Given a set of desired silhouette images, a global geometric optimization builds a 3D shadow volume that can subsequently be edited by the artist using a set of 3D modeling tools. The reinterpretation of jazz and non-jazz music is crucial in jazz pieces - in the same way, a shadow object can be seen as a 3D interpretation of the desired 2D shadows.', 'Pushparajan,K', 'MET:504.45 m', 'USA:21 June 1941', 'USA:18 August 1950",
