The only common story elements between the novel and the film are its title and two henchman Jaws and Sandor who are loosely inspired by the book''s villains Horror (with steel-capped teeth) and Slugsy (short and bald). The film is considered as the first Bond film whose story is completely original. (The second would be _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).) Fleming only allowed the novel''s title to be used as it was told in the first person of a Bond girl character, with James Bond himself only appearing in chapters 10-14 out of 15. The names of the heroine (Vivienne Michel) and the villains'' employer (Mr. Saguinetti) are not mentioned in the movie. The novelization of the film by screenwriter ''Christopher Wood (I)'' (qv) was called \"James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me\" so as to distinguish it from Fleming''s novel. This was the first novelization of a Bond film, rather than the other way around. Some later Bond movies, namely _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv) and _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv), followed the example of using a one of Fleming''s titles and creating a wholly or mostly new story for it.', 'UK:7 October 2011', 'Italy:June 1958', 'Iceland:24 May 2002', 'UK:13 July 2001')\n AND t.production_year > 1976;",

Their stories reflect a diversity of experiences, demonstrating how gender role expectations and homophobia are interwoven, and illustrating the different ways that these expectations connect with culture, race and class. From girls confronting media messages about culture and body image to boys who are sexually active just to prove they aren''t gay, this fascinating array of students opens up with brave, intimate honesty about the toll that deeply held stereotypes and rigid gender policing have on all our lives. Filmed in the same intimate style as That''s a Family! and Let''s Get Real, the heart of Straightlaced is candid interviews with more than 50 teens from diverse backgrounds. Straightlaced includes the perspectives of teens who self-identify as straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning and represent all points of the gender spectrum. With courage and unexpected humor, they open up their lives to the camera: choosing between \"male\" and \"female\" deodorant; deciding whether to go along with anti-gay taunts in the locker room; having the courage to take ballet; avoiding the restroom so they won''t get beaten up; or mourning the suicide of a classmate. It quickly becomes clear that just about everything teens do requires thinking about gender and sexuality. Coming of age today has become increasingly complex and challenging; Straightlaced offers both teens and adults a way out of anxiety, fear and violence and points the way toward a more inclusive, empowering culture.', '- January 2012', 'Echo Film', 'USA:20 October 1971', 'DOP 10,000,000')\n AND t.production_year > 2008;",

Shadow art is a unique form of sculptural art that exploits the fact that we can recognize objects from their shadows or silhouettes. Improvisation, a key ingredient of jazz music, is mirrored in the ambiguity of a shadow sculpture: many different 3D shapes can cast the same 2D shadow. The movie highlights five different milestones in the evolution of jazz: the early songs of field workers, ragtime, New Orleans jazz, swing, and bebop. Each era is represented with a room containing 3D sculptures which cast multiple shadow images at the same time. This unique property is achieved using a novel computational method for the interactive creation and manipulation of shadow art. Given a set of desired silhouette images, a global geometric optimization builds a 3D shadow volume that can subsequently be edited by the artist using a set of 3D modeling tools. The reinterpretation of jazz and non-jazz music is crucial in jazz pieces - in the same way, a shadow object can be seen as a 3D interpretation of the desired 2D shadows.', 'Pushparajan,K', 'MET:504.45 m', 'USA:21 June 1941', 'USA:18 August 1950')\n AND t.production_year > 2008;",
