This is in reference to the 'Clive Cussler' (qv) novel _Raise the Titanic (1980)_ (qv) where Dirk Pitt brings the ship up (it was written several years before the real Titanic was found to be shattered beyond reach on the bottom of the ocean). The second article is about the discovery of the Oiseau Blanc. This plane was of French origin and was attempting to be the first plane to make a non-stop Paris to New York flight just weeks before 'Charles A. Lindbergh' (qv)'s successful journey. The plane left France and was never seen again, but several people in northern Maine claimed to have heard an airplane above the cloud cover at about the right time. Interestingly, in Cussler's \"Sea Hunters II\", he describes how he and his real-life NUMA team of volunteers went searching for the Oiseau Blanc in the forests of Maine, but were unable to find it. He suggests that it likely went down in a large bog. Note that Lindbergh's flight is often mistaken for the first transatlantic flight, his was the first 'solo' transatlantic flight and the first flight from New York to Paris non-stop, but the first transatlantic flight was Alcock and Brown in a WWI Vickers Vimy bomber in 1919, almost eight years before.

This is in reference to the 'Clive Cussler' (qv) novel _Raise the Titanic (1980)_ (qv) where Dirk Pitt brings the ship up (it was written several years before the real Titanic was found to be shattered beyond reach on the bottom of the ocean). The second article is about the discovery of the Oiseau Blanc. This plane was of French origin and was attempting to be the first plane to make a non-stop Paris to New York flight just weeks before 'Charles A. Lindbergh' (qv)'s successful journey. The plane left France and was never seen again, but several people in northern Maine claimed to have heard an airplane above the cloud cover at about the right time. Interestingly, in Cussler's \"Sea Hunters II\", he describes how he and his real-life NUMA team of volunteers went searching for the Oiseau Blanc in the forests of Maine, but were unable to find it. He suggests that it likely went down in a large bog. Note that Lindbergh's flight is often mistaken for the first transatlantic flight, his was the first 'solo' transatlantic flight and the first flight from New York to Paris non-stop, but the first transatlantic flight was Alcock and Brown in a WWI Vickers Vimy bomber in 1919, almost eight years before.

While Gator the waiter spills his problems to a compassionate Conan O'Brien (thanks for the cameo), Queer Duck goes on a personal odyssey that ultimately leads to a showdown with a television evangelist at a theme park re-christened Fairyland.

Nancy finds Danny swimming nude in the pool, and he encourages her to undress and allow him to fondle her, but Dan's behavior goes too far for her, and she runs away in anger. In Nancy's dreams, Danny bears down on a motorcycle and they make love in the woods. the father and mother are involved in these dreams also, becoming more like nightmares, imagining them acting out S&M rituals. Nancy, becoming more and more terrified, vows she must never sleep again. Finally, in exhaustion, she tries to run away from home. Her parents rush out to find a doctor and leave Danny to watch over her, drugging Nancy first with sleeping pills to keep her calm. In a continuing dream sequence, Nancy now sees murals of people turning into a fantastic orgy in which she is ravished by a multitude. She then begins to sleep walk and comes upon Danny, and acts out these dreams with him. In climaxing, she awakens.

But in reality, this real-life event that Billy Hayes encountered of a thorough search of each passenger was a reaction to the PLO hijacking (and subsequent destruction) of four passenger jets in Europe just four weeks prior to the event portrayed at the beginning of the film (October 6, 1970). There are two somewhat oblique references to this event early in the film: a headline on the paper that Susan is reading on the bus that takes them to the plane (\"Nixon Outraged at Palestinian Hijackers\"), and again in the car after his arrest when Tex says \"You decided to fly at a bad time... guerrillas all over the place, blowing' up planes... 4 planes in 4 days\".", "m"], ["(additional location assistant) (uncredited)', '(as M.
