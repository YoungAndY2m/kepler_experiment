Burrows (aka \"Milwaukee Steve\") finally makes it big as \"The Crotch Fresh\" commercial guy, but then can''t catch another break -- not even when he auditions for a new Crotch Fresh commercial! He decides the only way to make a comeback as an actor is to fake his own death, then make a glorious return. Before that idea pans out, Milwaukee goes on \"Wheel of Fortune\", and become notorious when he''s sued by the Merv Griffin Corp. \"Milwaukee Steve\" becomes a hot ticket, with numerous folks riding his coattails. However, after a studio hires him to write a script, nothing works out as planned. Desperate, broke, and depressed, Steve returns to Milwaukee, in mid-winter, to gain comfort from family and friends -- only to find his mother has rented out his room while on her annual trip to the Netherlands. \"Milwaukee\" then recounts his Los Angeles'' saga to his mom''s boarder as they explore some of Milwaukee''s more amusing locales. By the end of the film we''ve met a host of crazy characters, and we are rooting for \"Milwaukee Steve/The Crotch Fresh Guy\" to find his own brand of \"fame, fortune, cheese, and beer.\"', 'China:November 1936', 'LAB:WRS Laboratory', 'Denmark:28 May 1999', 'Spain:15 June 1980')\n AND t.production_year > 1999;",

There are numerous sequences and the major ones are noted as follows: - \"Sara''s Regret\" - This scene expanded upon how vulnerable Sara Moore (played by Kathryn Morris) was. The FBI agent''s character is developed further. The setting has the agent behind a desk after cracking under the pressure of an intense field assignment. The scene is introspective in nature. - \"The Instructor''s Office\" - The scene is set in the FBI instructor''s office for the character Jake Harris played by Val Kilmer. Harris speaks with Sara played by Kathryn Morris and J.D. Reston played by Christian Slater. The verbal communication between Harris and J.D. is professional and almost military in nature, but it is clear that Harris has doubts related to Sara''s performance. The performance review is completed and in the process a caustic exchange transpires in which Harris directly questions her ability. This establishes Sara''s potential motive. - \"Ride Along\" - In a scene on the helicopter pad at the FBI training complex, Gabe Jensen played by LL Cool J and Jake Harris played by Val Kilmer speak in a caustic capacity before any of the agents arrive. Harris is ordered by his superiors to allow Gabe Jensen to observe his class and teaching methods. In this exchange Harris and Jensen makes their feelings plainly clear. This established a potential motive for both Jensen and Harris. - \"Rappelling\" - In a brief scene in the film personnel are seen rappelling out of a helicopter and securing a hot landing zone during a training exercise. This scene set the stage for later in the film when Harris tells his class to get their rappelling lines out of the back of the helicopter when nearing Oniega. The joke then seems more intense and relevant. - \"The ending\" - Several variations of the ending were filmed.
