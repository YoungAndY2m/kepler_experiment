Reese talks to John before he volunteers to be sent through time; it is implied that Reese learns that he is in fact John''s father. After Reese is sent, John enters a storage cabinet full of Terminators (different types even). One of the 101-models is missing (being the Terminator from the first movie). John hints that he needs to send another one himself. After that, the rest of the movie is effectively one long flashback of John. - Sarah''s ECT where Sarah is fitted for electro-convulsive therapy and voltage is pumped into her. She relives several moments from her live, most prominently the T-800 chasing her through the factory in the previous film. - Alternate nuclear nightmare scene. Sarah dreams that the Terminator takes her out of the asylum towards the fence, where she sees nuclear silos opening, firing their missiles. One nuclear bomb goes off, ripping off both her flesh and the Terminator''s. Then she wakes up. - Salceda''s death sequence. Sal''s dog starts barking, Sal goes out tries to shoot the T-1000 and fails. T-1000 uses the pointed finger/sword trick to Sal''s shoulder blades saying \"I know this hurts. Where is John Connor\". Sal curses him and his hands search around the ground near some crates that hold grenades. He blows himself up and hopefully the T-1000 with one. No luck. T-1000 head falls off but like the little piece in the asylum escape sequence, it oozes back into his boots. Yolanda sees this and hugs the baby as T-1000 steps closer. T-1000 picks up the baby and gets the info from her as where John and others had gone. - Gant Ranch. This section was a longer version of Sal''s and refers to Travis Gant, \"crazy ex-Green Beret\" that John mentions his mother seeing before she was caught. Longer and has romantic notions between the two. After Sarah, John and the Terminator left, T-1000 kills Gant as he did like with John''s \"Mom\". Disguised as Gant''s lover, he easily stepped up to him and tortured him for answers before killing him. - Dyson''s Vision Sequence. Dyson, the creator of the new processor had a dream sequence before he died and dropped the device on the trigger. In it he saw a picture of his family before a nuclear inferno turned it to ash. He sees his family running and then a scene of the sun as it pulls back to reveal Dyson''s dying eye before he closes it and drops the book.

Anthony was a black ex-con just recently out of prison who got a job at Sugarbakers doing delivery work.

Julia''s sometimes commanding boyfriend Reese visited and so did Charlene''s husband Bill who is a US Colonel. Further uproar in Mary Jo''s part included her confrontations with her children Quint and Claudia and her ex-husband Ted, until she got a new boyfriend named J.D. By far, Sugarbaker''s frequent customer was the crazy old lady named Bernice. In 1989, Reese died and Suzanne moved away. Julia was forced to babysit the rich spoiled 10-year old Randa Oliver for a few weeks and Julia and her made a quick relationship between young and old. In 1991, Charlene and Bill also left to pursue other things, but Charlene''s sister Carlene took her place as well did Julia''s mean, snobby cousin Allison.

It was first published on 18 April 1962. The only common story elements between the novel and the film are its title and two henchman Jaws and Sandor who are loosely inspired by the book''s villains Horror (with steel-capped teeth) and Slugsy (short and bald). The film is considered as the first Bond film whose story is completely original. (The second would be _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).) Fleming only allowed the novel''s title to be used as it was told in the first person of a Bond girl character, with James Bond himself only appearing in chapters 10-14 out of 15. The names of the heroine (Vivienne Michel) and the villains'' employer (Mr. Saguinetti) are not mentioned in the movie. The novelization of the film by screenwriter ''Christopher Wood (I)'' (qv) was called \"James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me\" so as to distinguish it from Fleming''s novel.

The scene is introspective in nature. - \"The Instructor''s Office\" - The scene is set in the FBI instructor''s office for the character Jake Harris played by Val Kilmer. Harris speaks with Sara played by Kathryn Morris and J.D. Reston played by Christian Slater. The verbal communication between Harris and J.D. is professional and almost military in nature, but it is clear that Harris has doubts related to Sara''s performance. The performance review is completed and in the process a caustic exchange transpires in which Harris directly questions her ability. This establishes Sara''s potential motive. - \"Ride Along\" - In a scene on the helicopter pad at the FBI training complex, Gabe Jensen played by LL Cool J and Jake Harris played by Val Kilmer speak in a caustic capacity before any of the agents arrive. Harris is ordered by his superiors to allow Gabe Jensen to observe his class and teaching methods. In this exchange Harris and Jensen makes their feelings plainly clear. This established a potential motive for both Jensen and Harris. - \"Rappelling\" - In a brief scene in the film personnel are seen rappelling out of a helicopter and securing a hot landing zone during a training exercise. This scene set the stage for later in the film when Harris tells his class to get their rappelling lines out of the back of the helicopter when nearing Oniega. The joke then seems more intense and relevant. - \"The ending\" - Several variations of the ending were filmed. One of them included Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) and numerous others included modified character development from the final theatrical ending.', 'USA:13 July 1937', 'Ukraine:50', 'Lewend Tasin', 'Mexico:16 July 1942", 2003], ["distributors", "%A%", "%c%", "$20,216,440 (USA) (25 March 2007)', '42150', '1,330,000 (Japan)', 'Spain:9 May 2010', '6719", 2006], ["distributors", "%2%", "%2%", "Australia:3 April 2010', 'USA:18 October 2014', 'UK:12 June 1953', 'Keep your cool', 'Letter to My Killer", 2009], ["distributors", "%l%", "%y%", "$3,447,678 (USA) (12 April 2009)', 'France:12 May 2004', 'Norway:21 July 2000', '$24,741,700 (USA)', 'Japan:11 July 1973", 2007], ["distributors", "%2%", "%3%", "Holden: You''re a hooker, you hooker.', 'Two of a Kind', 'Levkas, Greece', 'Ocala, Florida, USA', 'USA:7 December 1918", 2001], ["distributors", "%r%", "%V%", "CONT: When Fran is in the Bridal shop, and Danny is in the process of proposing to her.
