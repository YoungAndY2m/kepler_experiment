The era of the ability to synthesise and create, on an unlimited scale, new chemicals that had never existed before in the world. So, suddenly it became possible to produce any new synthetic chemical, the like of which had never existed before in the world, for any purpose and at virtually no cost. For instance, if you wanted to go to a chemist and say, ''Look, I want to have chemical, say a pesticide that will persist throughout the food chain and I don''t want to have to renew it very, very often, I''d like it to be relatively non-destructible'', and then he''d put 2 benzene molecules on the blackboard and add a chlorine here, and a chlorine there, that was DDT! As the petrochemical era grew and grew, warning signs emerged that some of these chemicals could pose hazards. The data initially were trivial, anecdotal, but gradually, a body of data started accumulating to the extent that we now know that the synthetic chemicals, which have permeated our workplace, our consumer products, our air, our water, produced cancer, and also birth defects and some other toxic effects. Furthermore, industry has known about this, at least most industries have known about this, and have attempted to trivialise these risks. If I take a gun and shoot you, that''s criminal. If I expose you to some chemicals, which knowingly are going to kill you, what difference is there? The difference is that it takes longer to kill you. We are now in the midst of a major cancer epidemic and I have no doubt and I have documented the basis for this, that industry is largely responsible for this overwhelming epidemic of cancer, in which 1 in every two men get cancer in their lifetimes, and 1 in every 3 women get cancer in their lifetimes.', '$306,061 (USA)', 'UK:12 July 1997', 'Finland:1 May 1947', 'USA:26 January 1991", "0000001222", 1924, 2012], ["[se]", "distributors", "taglines", "votes distribution", "It''s about men, women, choices, friendship, love, last night...', 'Canada:10 June 1999', 'UK:13 June 1979', 'Poland:30 June 2000', 'USA:25 March 1991", "0000121100", 1925, 2008], ["[fr]", "production companies", "tech info", "votes distribution", "OFM:35 mm', '$22,488 (UK)', 'USA:13 October 1911', 'UK:21 October 1952', 'USA:5 December 1974", "...1011210", 1985, 2006], ["[us]", "production companies", "certificates", "votes distribution", "UK:U', '5267', 'Sweden:2 July 1929', 'Austria:1919', 'Japan:April 1939", "0000.....6", 1930, 1977], ["[br]", "distributors", "weekend gross", "votes", "$1,389,848 (USA) (10 November 2002) (58 screens)', 'Russia:5 March 2008', 'Speak Your Peace.', 'UK:14 November 1999', 'Chile:48", "272185", 1909, 2017], ["[jp]", "distributors", "quotes", "rating", "Peter Bradley: [interviewing Eli Cash on television] Now, your previous novel...::Eli: Yes, Wildcat.::Peter Bradley: Not a success.

During 1985 Gursharan Singh Soman lived a peaceful life as a farmer in rural Punjab, along with his elderly parents, Gurdev and Tejpal, and an unmarried sister, Guddi. Gursharan meets with and gets engaged to the Station House Officer''s only daughter, Jassi Sandhu. Shortly thereafter her father is killed in a drive-by shooting, and a new Officer, Randhawa, takes over from him. Far from being ethical and honest, he is only concerned with fulfilling a quota of deaths of so-called terrorists by fake police encounters. Jassi and Gursharan get married as Jassi has no other relatives. When the police find a duffel bag of automatic weapons in Soman''s house, they immediately arrest Gursharan and beat him up severely, even though he claims his innocence, alleging that real terrorists had forced themselves upon the family at gun-point. When a deputation from the town asks Randhawa to set him free, he does so, and the Soman family settle down. Guddi is soon to get married to a young man who loves her. Then in July, 1987, Sikh terrorists gun down a bus full of non-Sikhs, setting off a shock wave in the entire country. Punjab Police are instructed to maintain order, even if it means to do away with law. A large number of Sikhs are hunted down and killed in fake police encounters, scores are arrested and tortured. Gursharan is arrested again and severely beaten up in police custody. When Guddi goes to plead with Randhawa to release him, she too is imprisoned and beaten by a burly policewoman. Gursharan''s American-based friend, Darshan Singh Gill, comes to their rescue and arranges for Gursharan to visit the U.S.A. on a travel visa as a hockey player. Once in America, Gursharan applies for political asylum, and is granted one, which also permits him to sponsor Jassi, and his new-born son to America. After Jassi''s arrival, Gursharan gets a job in a corner store, while Jassi works as a Gas Attendant. It is then Gursharan gets the news that his father has suffered a heart-attack and may not live long. Gursharan is ready to leave for India to be near his family in this crucial hour, but his leaving America may well revoke his political asylum, and even if he does leave America and arrives in India, there is more than a bullet from the Punjab Police awaiting him.', 'USA:3 February 1937', '57,923 (Sweden)', 'S.S.P.M.S., India', '[last lines]", "94", 1933, 2006], ["[lb]", "distributors", "certificates", "votes", "Singapore:PG', 'MET:757 m', 'UK:21 December 1956', 'Apocalypse Now', 'LVD 9222", "5342", 1995, 2020], ["[jp]", "production companies", "alternate versions", "votes distribution", "In the original American version of the film, end credits and the Transworld logo were present.

After Reese is sent, John enters a storage cabinet full of Terminators (different types even). One of the 101-models is missing (being the Terminator from the first movie). John hints that he needs to send another one himself. After that, the rest of the movie is effectively one long flashback of John. - Sarah''s ECT where Sarah is fitted for electro-convulsive therapy and voltage is pumped into her. She relives several moments from her live, most prominently the T-800 chasing her through the factory in the previous film. - Alternate nuclear nightmare scene. Sarah dreams that the Terminator takes her out of the asylum towards the fence, where she sees nuclear silos opening, firing their missiles. One nuclear bomb goes off, ripping off both her flesh and the Terminator''s. Then she wakes up. - Salceda''s death sequence. Sal''s dog starts barking, Sal goes out tries to shoot the T-1000 and fails. T-1000 uses the pointed finger/sword trick to Sal''s shoulder blades saying \"I know this hurts. Where is John Connor\". Sal curses him and his hands search around the ground near some crates that hold grenades. He blows himself up and hopefully the T-1000 with one. No luck. T-1000 head falls off but like the little piece in the asylum escape sequence, it oozes back into his boots. Yolanda sees this and hugs the baby as T-1000 steps closer. T-1000 picks up the baby and gets the info from her as where John and others had gone. - Gant Ranch. This section was a longer version of Sal''s and refers to Travis Gant, \"crazy ex-Green Beret\" that John mentions his mother seeing before she was caught. Longer and has romantic notions between the two. After Sarah, John and the Terminator left, T-1000 kills Gant as he did like with John''s \"Mom\". Disguised as Gant''s lover, he easily stepped up to him and tortured him for answers before killing him. - Dyson''s Vision Sequence. Dyson, the creator of the new processor had a dream sequence before he died and dropped the device on the trigger. In it he saw a picture of his family before a nuclear inferno turned it to ash. He sees his family running and then a scene of the sun as it pulls back to reveal Dyson''s dying eye before he closes it and drops the book.

Terribly rude also rang a lot of bells. So very fat and very rude seems to have been a stranger''s viewpoint. On the other hand, some of you have been kind enough to ring me and let me know that you loved him, which I know he would have been thrilled to hear.

As for me, you may ask how I will remember him, what I thought of him. Unfortunately there I run out of words. Perhaps you will forgive me if I turn from my own feelings to the words of another splendid bugger: W.H. Auden.
