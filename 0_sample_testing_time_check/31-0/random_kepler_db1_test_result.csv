This is a reference to the lyric, ""Take a drink from his special cup, Doctor Robert."" - ""Get Back"": A voice is heard yelling ""Get Back!"" when Sadie leaves the stage during ""Oh! Darling"". - ""Strawberry Fields Forever"": During the Thanksgiving dinner scene, Lucy''s and Max''s grandmother remarks that ""the cranberry sauce isn''t as tangy as last year,"" referencing the use of the words ""cranberry sauce"" uttered by John (which was often misheard as ""I buried Paul,"" adding to the myth that Paul was dead.) - ""Maxwell''s Silver Hammer"": At college, Max generally goofs off and causes trouble. This is a reference to the song lyric, ""Back in school again/Maxwell plays the fool again."" Also, when Max and Jude first meet Sadie, she says they seem harmless, then looks at Max and says, ""Then again, you coulda murdered your granny with a hammer."" Max is later seen ""fixing"" a fan with a hammer. - ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"": The name Molly (Jude''s Liverpool girlfriend) alludes to Molly in the song. - ""The Word"": When discussing Dr. Robert''s bus Sadie''s manager says ""Spread the word"". - ""A Day In The Life"": When Jeff Beck''s instrumental cover of ""A Day In The Life"" plays, Jude is reading a newspaper - a reference to the lyric, ""I read the news today, oh boy."" - ""I Want You"": The famous Uncle Sam recruitment poster is animated to illustrate the song. - ""Martha My Dear"": Jude''s mother''s name is Martha. - ""Lovely Rita"": Prudence''s friend''s name is Rita. - ""Sexy Sadie"": Though the character of Sadie is a reference to Janis Joplin, it is also a reference to this song. - ""Get Back"": While JoJo''s character is a reference to ''Jimi Hendrix'' (qv), it is also a reference to ""Get Back"" (particularly the first line ""JoJo was a man who thought he was a loner/But he knew it wouldn''t last."") - ""Revolution 9"": The number of the building where the rooftop concert takes place is #9. - ""Hello Goodbye"": After Prudence enters through the bathroom window, Jude greets her saying ""Hello, hello"" which can be seen as a reference to ""Hello Goodbye"" (which was called Hello Hello by McCartney while he was writing it). - ""She Came In Through the Bathroom Window"": When Prudence first enters the apartment through the window, Jude comments ""She came in through the bathroom window."" - ""When I''m Sixty-Four"": The shipyard employee that gives Jude his paycheck says he thought he''d be doing something different when he was sixty-four.', 'USA:1 March 1939', 'MET:4457.29 m', 'UK:29 January 1980', 'UK:28 November 1986') AND n.gender = 'm' LIMIT 5;"
