This film sequence was quickly edited in order to be used during the scenes of the orchestra recording sessions. The studio orchestra composer-conductor''s office was the first sequence of scenes filmed when the company moved onto the stage. (After this set was filmed, construction turned this set around to become the police station). The company moved outside of the stage, where the exterior of the composer''s studio bungalow office was built in the open parking stage space. (Interesting trivia is that the Findlay exterior and interior set of the bungalow was based upon the Spanish styled architecture of production office bungalows at Warner Brothers Studio. The crew immediately identified with the sets similarity to the Warner Brothers'' facility). The orchestra recording sessions followed in the filming schedule; then the basement elevator set; followed by the exterior stage roof top elevator shaft (exterior Technicolor top deck parking structure); followed by the exterior of the sound stage. Scouting locations for budget reasons, the preliminary plan was to use the studio musicians'' union hall facility in Hollywood, California, for the recording session scenes. After lengthy creative production meetings, this plan was discarded because of the location expenses for facility dressing rooms and to make the location fit the script requirements. Placing the production back at the Universal Studio lot allowed more creative control for Patrick McGoohan (director) and Peter Falk. Patrick McGoohan had made extensive script rewrites for the main characters and for the murder plot, which included the onstage elevator shaft sequence. Peter Falk enjoyed working with Patrick because the two of them could invent, contrive, vastly improving the script scenario and character development.' AND n.gender = 'm' LIMIT 5;"
